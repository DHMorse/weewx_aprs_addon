This is a quick add-on for the Weewx system to allow it to send APRS weather
packets to a radio TNC connected to the same server as the weather station.

This is the first time I've coded in Python, and I don't have much experience
with programming serial ports, so I'm sure this could be much better. Also,
the commands and behaviors of different TNCs can have enough variance that I
don't know how useful this will be for others.

This was created using Weewx version 1.13.1. The author has indicated that
there will be a more modular facility for adding RESTful protocols in a future
release, so this code will probably be obsolete before long.

Please send any improvements to Brad McConahay at brad@mcconahay.com.
